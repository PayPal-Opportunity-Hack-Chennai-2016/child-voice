# Creating a Vagrantfile.local file allows you to extend the Vagrant configuration
# with options specific to this local machine.


# The default setup is geared towards trying out the demo site, and building your
# own Wagtail-powered sites based on it. If you wish to develop Wagtail itself,
# you'll want to have an editable copy of the Wagtail code on your host machine,
# and share this with the virtual machine to be used instead of the packaged
# copy of Wagtail.
# 
# Clone https://github.com/torchbox/wagtail somewhere convenient, and replace
# "../wagtail" below with the correct path:

config.vm.synced_folder "../wagtail", "/home/vagrant/wagtail"


# You'll also need to configure your Python environment within the VM to pick up this
# instance of Wagtail rather than the packaged one; usually this is done by running
# `./setup.py develop` within the checked-out Wagtail codebase.
